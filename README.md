This sample solution helps you get started with the PDF Tools .NET SDK.

The sample projects illustrate how to perform PDF-related actions (such as converting to and from the PDF format) using the PDF Tools .NET SDK. **Please note that the PDF Tools .NET SDK supports only server side use cases**.

## Prerequisites
The sample solution has the following requirements:
* .NET Core: version 2.1 or above  
* Build Tool: The solution requires Visual studio or .NET Core CLI to be installed to be able to run the sample projects.

## Authentication Setup
The credentials file and corresponding private key file for the samples is ```pdftools-api-credentials.json``` and ```private.key``` respectively. 
Before the samples can be run, replace both the files with the ones present in the downloaded zip file at the end of creation of credentials via [Get Started](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/gettingstarted.html?ref=getStartedWithServicesSdk) workflow.

## Quota Exhaustion
If you receive ServiceUsageException during the Samples run, it means that trial credentials have exhausted their usage quota. Please [contact us](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_requestform) to get paid credentials.

## Build with .NET Core CLI
Run the following command to build the project:
```$xslt
dotnet build
```

Note that the PDF Tools SDK is listed as a dependency and will be downloaded automatically.

## A Note on Logging
Following component is being used by SDK:
* [LibLog](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog) (MIT) as bridge between different logging frameworks.  

Log4net is used as a logging provider in the sample projects and the logging configurations are provided in ```log4net.config```.   

**Note**: Add the configuration for your preferred provider and set up the necessary appender as required for logging to work.

## Running the samples
The following sub-sections describe how to run the samples. Prior to running the samples, check that the configuration file is set up as described above and that the project has been built.  

The code is in the different sample projects under the solution folder. Test files used by the samples can be found in the project directory itself. When executed, all samples create an ```output``` 
child folder under the working directory to store their results.

for performing an operation. This enables the clients to fetch the credentials from a secret server during runtime, 
instead of storing them in a file.

Before running the sample, authentication credentials need to be updated as per the instructions in the code.

```$xslt
cd CreatePDFWithInMemoryAuthCredentials/
dotnet run CreatePDFWithInMemoryAuthCredentials.csproj
```

```$xslt
cd CreatePDFFromStaticHtml/
dotnet run CreatePDFFromStaticHtml.csproj
```

#### Create a PDF File From Dynamic HTML (via Zip Archive)

with the input data to a PDF file. The input data is used by the javascript in the HTML file to manipulate the HTML DOM, 
thus effectively updating the source HTML file. This mechanism can be used to provide data to the template HTML 
dynamically and then, convert it into a PDF file.

```$xslt
cd CreatePDFFromDynamicHtml/
dotnet run CreatePDFFromDynamicHtml.csproj
```
